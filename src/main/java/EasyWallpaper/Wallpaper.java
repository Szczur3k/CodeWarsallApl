/*
John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.
John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters.
The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters.
He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations
so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

Rolka ma 52cm WIDTH
Rolka ma 10metrow LENGTH


Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.
